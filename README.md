# Notes

I have worked on only 1 Vue project in my career, a personal site that was simply static (2 years ago) that I upgraded to a Nuxt app last year. This coding exercise was an excellent opportunity for me to dive in to your tech stack. That said, the finished product was quite basic as you will see.

My overall goal was to use Vuetify and Nuxt3 together (along with Vitest), which proved to be a bit difficult. I certainly burned time doing this, but I believe that I covered all the tasks.

My day-to-day framework is Angular and I've used it for about 3 years now. Overall, I've been a frontend engineer for over 20 years, spanning many technologies (as well as OO JavaScript).
