# Notes

I've been a front end engineer for just over 20 years but I have worked on 2 Vue projects in my career, the last one just over a year ago (which was Nuxt).

My goal was to use Vuetify and Nuxt3, which proved to be a bit difficult during the integration portion. I certainly burned several hours doing this and you can see that my app is very basic. But I believe that I covered all the tasks.

My day-to-day framework is Angular and I've used it for about 3 years now. But I wanted to use Vue and Nuxt because I know that is your dev stack, and it's fun to learn new stuff.

Personally, I'd certainly want someone more well-versed in these technologies than myself, but I do appreciate the time you took. I certainly enjoyed learning about the composition api.
